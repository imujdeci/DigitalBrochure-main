Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Full-Stack TypeScript Application
The application follows a monorepo structure with separate client and server directories, sharing common types and schemas through a shared directory. The system uses modern web technologies with TypeScript throughout for type safety.

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite for development and building
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **File Uploads**: Multer for handling file uploads (templates, logos)
- **Development**: Hot reload with Vite integration

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Simple username/password authentication
- Client-side session management with localStorage
- Protected routes requiring authentication
- Default test credentials (username: "test", password: "test")

## Data Flow

### Client-Server Communication
1. Frontend makes HTTP requests to backend API endpoints
2. Backend processes requests and interacts with PostgreSQL database
3. Responses are returned as JSON with appropriate status codes
4. TanStack Query manages caching and state synchronization

### File Upload Flow
1. Files uploaded through multipart/form-data
2. Multer middleware processes uploads to local storage
3. File paths stored in database for reference
4. Files served through static routes or API endpoints

### Campaign Creation Workflow
1. User searches and selects products
2. Products added to campaign with quantities and discounts
3. Template and logo selected for brochure design
4. Campaign saved as draft or activated
5. Brochure generated and available for download

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **Neon Database**: PostgreSQL hosting service
- **Connection**: Uses @neondatabase/serverless for connections
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management

### UI Components
- **Radix UI**: Comprehensive set of unstyled, accessible components
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- **Embla Carousel**: Carousel/slider functionality
- **Date-fns**: Date manipulation and formatting

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production
- **Replit Integration**: Development environment optimizations

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. Frontend built using Vite to static assets in `dist/public`
2. Backend bundled using ESBuild to `dist/index.js`
3. Single deployable artifact with server serving static files

### Environment Configuration
- Database connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Development vs production mode detection
- File upload directory configuration

### Production Considerations
- Static file serving for uploaded assets
- Database connection pooling
- Error handling and logging
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
